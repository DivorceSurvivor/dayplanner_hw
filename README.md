You can plan your workday using this scheduler.
You can add events for your standard business hours using this application. The events are stored locally on the browser and can be accessed anytime.

Time blocks have different colors:

1. Red: Current hour
2. Green: Present hours
3. Grey: Past hours

You can add any event in the input box and click on the save button to save the event for that time block.
